# Blog Posts Storage

This directory contains all blog posts for the website in markdown format.

## File Structure

Each blog post is stored as a separate markdown file with the following format:

```
---
title: "Blog Post Title"
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
excerpt: "A short description of the blog post"
coverImage: "/images/blog/cover-image.jpg"
---

The actual content of the blog post in markdown format.
```

## Naming Convention

Files should be named using kebab-case with a format of:
`YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-post.md`

Example: `2023-10-15-getting-started-with-react-hooks.md`
```
